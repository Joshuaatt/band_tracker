Band tracker 

Authored by Joshua Atteberry

This application allows the user to add, edit, and delete bands from a database. They may also assign a venue to a band. 

This was written as a demonstration for using many to many relationships in Activerecord.

To install, clone repository, run bundle, and open app.rb in Ruby.
